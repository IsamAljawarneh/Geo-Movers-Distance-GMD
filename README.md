# Geo-Movers-Distance-GMD
Geo-Mover's Distance (GMD) is a new metric for quantification of (dis)similarity between aggregate geo-maps of gig geospatial datasets.
# how to run the code (the prototype):
- you can simply run the self-contained notebook titled `Geo_Movers_Distance_GMD`  [available online](https://github.com/IsamAljawarneh/Geo-Movers-Distance-GMD/blob/master/Geo_Movers_Distance_GMD.ipynb)
